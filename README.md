# High level approach
We followed the suggested strategy in the prompt to begin coding.
The first step is to receive and send the handshake message and try to pass the few first tests.
Then we started to implement each functionality of the BGP router and tested on different configurations.

# Challenge
The challenge parts are to aggregate and disaggregate the netires.

# Test methods
We tested the whole program in several function blocks, and tried my program on different machines.
We started from the eaiest test and gradually level up to test on the more difficult ones.
And we took a step back to test all the previous tests after a new test is past.
